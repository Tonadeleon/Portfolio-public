I like dyGraphs, I wonder if instead of using a bar on the bottom we could use our mouse wheel and zoom in that way. Many time series graphs disregarding if its a line or boxplots per time period have this feature, like they do on [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NASDAQ%3AAAPL) for example.

Now about the graph itself, It looks like Tesla had a crazy rise above all others, and despite its volatility whoever bought Tesla in 2020 would still be in a major gain even as compared to others and even disregarding the drops it's had these last couple of years.
